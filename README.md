# Automachina
Automachina is an experimental, old-school-style survival and automation game.
You gather resources, build machines, and automate processes to survive in a 8-color pixel world.

Built with [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) in Rust, it features:

* Survival mechanics – manage resources and environment
* Automation systems – design workflows to keep things running
* Procedural terrain generation – explore unique worlds
* Minimalist retro visuals – inspired by early pixel art palettes
* Modular ECS architecture – easily extendable and scriptable

This is an early alpha, so expect bugs, missing features, and a lot of room for growth. Feedback is welcome!
